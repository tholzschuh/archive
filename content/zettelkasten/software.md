# software

In this note, I collect some software I'd like to check out more closely in the (near?) future.

## note-taking
* [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/): free software for taking handwritten notes.
* [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and other useful plugins.

## latex-setup
* [Latex input for impatient scholars](https://karthinks.com/software/latex-input-for-impatient-scholars/)
